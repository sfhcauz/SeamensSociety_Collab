Developing maps to highlight the northern area of Staten Island which has a lower Median Income (2018; second lowest quintile range $41,300 - $51,100) and lower levels of Broadband Adoption (both Mobile and Home/Residential).  Leveraged R-code for data transformations and merging (R-code loaded in this repository); used Tableau mappping for visuals (desktop version 2020; accessed through student account).  All data public data from NYC Open Data.

Future Analysis Plans:
Develop chloropleth maps using TidyCensus and population level data for Staten Island to determine community characteristics surrounding PreK locations.
